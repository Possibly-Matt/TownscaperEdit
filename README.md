# TownscaperEdit
An editing program for Townscaper save files

Install Python
Download TownscaperEdit.py
Save it to the Townscaper save file folder
    in Windows this is:
    %user\AppData\LocalLow\Oskar Stalberg\Townscaper
Run it (I recommend opening it in Idle and running it from there (F5))
Type in the number for the save file and press enter
Edit the data as desired (some Python skills required!)
run the save() function to save the changes back to disc
